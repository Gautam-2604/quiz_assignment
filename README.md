My thought with the project was simple, though I did not implement it properly. 
The idea was, Let the user join in, then give him 2 options, either create a room, or join a room. 
If you create a room, , you hit the create_room endpoint, then you get an ID, and you can share it with your friends.
If you want to join a room, you have to enter the code. 
On joining, you will have to enter the room server, giving you websocket connection to the question generator, and to other players, as well as the leaderboard. 
Leader board will be displayed in real time based on your answers.
The code is mostly generated through AI, based on the above idea
